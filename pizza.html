Recipe adapted from <a href="https://www.withspice.com/blog/artisan-pizza-dough-crispy-chewy-bubbly-crust/">this</a> recipe,
which itself is adapted from the Ken Forkish recipe in Flour, Water, Salt.
Note: this makes 2 servings of pizza dough.
Ingredients:
<ul>
    <li>500g AP flour</li>
    <li>375g warm water, divided</li>
    <li>1g active dry yeast</li>
    <li>10g fine salt</li>
</ul>
Steps:
<ol>
    <li>Mix flour and all but 1 tbsp of the water in a large bowl and set it aside 
        for 20 minutes. Mix the remaining 1 tbsp water with the yeast -- Don't expect 
        the yeast to bubble up like it does when making milk bread, it will just seem
        to dissolve and get cloudy. Also the specific temperature of the warm water
        is not super important here.
    </li>
    <li>Sprinkle salt over the surface of the dough. Stir yeast mixture and pour it
        over the dough. Fold the dough: reach under the dough and pull a section over
        the top. Repeat until the center of the dough is covered. Then, using your thumb
        and forefinger as pincers, squeeze and pinch 5-6 chunks of dough (it will look
        kind of like the michelin man's arm). Repeat the folding and pinching until the yeast
        and salt are fully incorporated and a shaggy dough is formed. Cover the bowl and let 
        rest for about an hour.
    </li>
    <li>Reach underneath the dough and pull a section over the top. Repeat about 5 times while 
        rotating the bowl, until the dough has tightened up into a ball. Take the dough and 
        put it into a new, lightly greased bowl. Cover and let rise until doubled in volume,
        about 5- 6 hours.
    </li>
    <li>
        Turn the dough out onto a floured surface, and divide it into two portions.
        Working with one piece at a time, stretch out a quarter of the dough just until you
        feel resistance, then fold it back over the center. Repeat with the other 3 quarters
        of dough until the center is covered and a loose ball is formed. Turn the ball
        over seam side down and place in an un-floured area. Cup your hands around the dough
        and gently pull it towards you, dragging the bottom of the dough across the counter
        to create tension. Rotate the ball 90 degrees and repeat. Keep repeating until the top
        of the dough tightens up and the ball is round.
    </li>
    <li>
        Transfer to a greased plate and repeat with the other portion of dough. Lightly 
        oil the tops, cover, and let rest at room temperature for about an hour. Preheat 
        oven at this time. If not using right away, cover tightly with plastic wrap and 
        refrigerate until ready (for up to 2 days).
    </li>
    <li>
        Preheat the oven to 500F. Flour a baking pan and set aside.
    </li>
    <li>
        Pick up a piece of dough and quickly rotate it like a steering wheel while 
        gravity pulls it down into a 12-inch pizza shape. (Note: I do this part really
        fast because letting it stretch too much makes the pizza too thin in the middle.
        I do this part just to get a general circle shape before shaping and stretching it
        further on the pan.)

    For a caccio e pepe pizza:
    <li>
        Microwave 2 minced garlic cloves with 1 tbsp of butter, then brush over the center of
        the pizza, leaving the 1-inch perimeter empty. Brush olive oil over the crust. Add 4 tbsp 
        of mozzarella and less than 1/3 cup whole milk ricotta cheese (1/3 cup is too much) on top. 
        Bake for 15 minutes, then remove from the oven and add anchovies and arugula. Grate parmesan 
        cheese over the top, and generously season with black pepper. Then broil the pizza on high 
        for 1 minute.
    </li>
    For prosciutto pizza:
    <li>
        Top the pizza with pizza sauce and 4 tbsp mozzarella, leaving the 1-inch perimeter empty.
        Brush olive oil over the crust. Bake for 15 minutes, then remove from the 
        oven. Top with arugula and prosciutto, then grate parmesan cheese over the top. Then broil the 
        pizza on high for 1 minute.
